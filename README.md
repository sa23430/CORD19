# Problem statement
Discover meaningful information from Covid-19 research articles

# Steps involved in the pipeline:

a) Identification of most frequent keywords in the full text of research articles.

b) Perform Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) on the combined set of entities recognised from full text of research articles and keywords 

c) Visualization LDA results: We propose to visualize the importance of topics in a selected document and the broadness of topics in a single chart.
